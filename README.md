# ML and DL algorithms from scratch
Machine Learning and Deep Learning  algorithm implementations from using vanilla python.

## Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

## K-Means
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear model, (i.e) the model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).

## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics. It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). In this post you will discover the logistic regression algorithm for machine learning.
